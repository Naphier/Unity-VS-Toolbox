#Visual Studio 2015 Unity 3D Toolbox
Included in this project is a VS toolbox for most of the Monobehaviour events listed in order of execution.</br>
You'll also find a bunch of templates that can be installed so they will show up in the Add Item context menu.

Please feel free to ask to contribute to this project. Next steps would be to add in the remaining Monobehaviour events and maybe add in some commented notes on some of the less common behaviours (or example code).

Cheers!

EDIT: I see there is a new version of Unity VS Tools available here: https://www.visualstudio.com/features/unitytools-vs </br>I'm not sure why these don't come with the Unity 5.2 installation wizard, but maybe they will in the future. After installing these there is a Implement Monobehaviour wizard that does similar to what this toolbox does, but so far it does not work for me. It also has a couple of templates.
